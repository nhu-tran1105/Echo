# Reflection – Nhu Tran

This semester taught me that beautiful design + clean code = magic.  
I learned to love semantic HTML, care about accessibility, and never hard-code content.

Using JSON + Fetch made everything so much cleaner.  
Building responsive sites that look good on phones is now my favorite thing.

Thank you for an amazing class!
